--> HTML Newspaper Recreation

Name: Junaid Saeed
Roll Number:22p-9200
Section:BCS-8A

--> Original Newspaper
Name: Daily Jang (Karachi Edition)
Date:Circa 1965 (Based on War Content)

--> Project Description
This project recreates the front page of the historic "Daily Jang" newspaper using only HTML5. The layout focuses on the 1965 war era, translating Urdu headlines into English while maintaining the visual hierarchy of the original print. The goal was to replicate the dense, column-based structure of old newspapers without using external CSS or JavaScript.

--> Features Implemented
1- Table Layout:Used a 3-column table structure to mimic the mechanical typesetting of the 1960s.
2- Semantic HTML:Implemented `<header>`, `<nav>`, `<article>`, `<section>`, and `<footer>` for better document structure.
3- Inline Styling:Used `style=""` attributes to control fonts (Times New Roman), borders, and alignment to match the vintage aesthetic.
4- Typography:utilized `<h1>` through `<h4>` tags to create a clear visual hierarchy for headlines and sub-headlines.

--> Challenges Faced
The main challenge was positioning elements precisely without CSS Flexbox or Grid. I solved this by using nested HTML tables and the `valign` attribute to align text and images correctly within columns.
